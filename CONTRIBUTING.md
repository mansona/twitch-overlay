# Contributing

This project is really just for my own stream. I have it public so that you can
see how I am doing the things that I do but I don't intend to turn this into a
general purpose stream overlay ðŸ™ˆ

Feel free to clone it and run it if you want to play around! And fork it if you
want to build something similar ðŸŽ‰

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with npm)

## Installation

* `git clone git@github.com:mansona/twitch-overlay.git`
* `cd twitch-overlay`
* `npm install`

## Running / Development

* `npm start`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
* Visit your tests at [http://localhost:4200/tests](http://localhost:4200/tests).

### Code Generators

Make use of the many generators for code, try `ember help generate` for more details

### Running Ember Tests

I personally prefer to run tests by running `npm start` and visiting [http://localhost:4200/tests](http://localhost:4200/tests)

* `ember test`
* `ember test --server`

### Linting

* `npm run lint`
* `npm run lint:fix`

### Building

* `npm run build`

### Deploying

Right now it's just an Ember app so you can point something like Netlify a repo
like this and it will work perfectly ðŸŽ‰ I will soon be adding a server component
so things get a bit more complicated then ðŸ˜‚
