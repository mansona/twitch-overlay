# The real_ate stream overlay ðŸŽ‰

This project contains the overlay I use when streaming on twitch! If you want to
see it in action you can catch me on https://twitch.tv/real_ate or catch up with
older streams on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKZPKwkEhyiCEIisAqKimYQ)

## Enabling chat overlay

This overlay now has a chat functionality ðŸŽ‰ but it's a bit hard to get it to work ðŸ™ƒ  I have created a `.example.env` file that you need to rename to `.env` and follow the instructions for each of the lines in that file. This file won't be committed to git after you rename it.
